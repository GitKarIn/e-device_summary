# Introduction 

All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file.

## E-device Working Group Overview

### Goals

In general, the goal of the electronic data entry sub-group of the DUWG is to research field data entry software and hardware devices (“e-devices”), and to generate resources that support IEP survey leads in selecting and deploying digital data-entry procedures.  This sub-group does not intend to suggest a single solution or software choice for all IEP surveys; rather, the sub-group aims to provide specific application reviews and testing, some methods development, and the start of an IEP e-device users network in effort to facilitate the independent decisions and potential transition of each IEP surveys to electronic data collection methods..

### Approach

A general approach to the exploration of e-device applications was outlined and agreed on at the initial e-device meetings.  

First, an e-device information gathering questionnaire (survey) would be distributed within IEP which specifically collects response data from: 1. Experienced e-device users, 2. Those who are currently researching e-device solutions for their survey applications; and 3. Those who have determined e-devices will not work for them. 

Second, following leads from the responses to the survey, this distribution is expanded to include external associates (ICF, NEON, CDFW Marine).  Follow-up interviews of the experienced e-device users and vendors are conducted, and demonstrations are arranged for the most promising e-device options.

Third, group members will potentially test specific e-devices apps by making use of free trial licenses, and these trials reported back to the group (SFBS & Yolo By-pass were early volunteers for trial forms development exercises).  Potentially other e-device methods will be researched and developed for demonstration purposes (e.g., collection and integration of external sensor data into e-device applications).
